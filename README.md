## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In completing this project I learnt how to position an element both vertically and horizontally, something which I struggled with before. Below is a code snippet of how I accomplished this:

```css
.container {
    margin: 0;
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

In the future I would like to make this web page responsive so the layout is maintained on both tablets and mobile phones.


### Useful resources

- [freecodecamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/css-vertical-align-how-to-center-a-div-text-or-an-image-example-code/) - This helped me for positioning the QR component in the center of the page, vertically and horizontally.
